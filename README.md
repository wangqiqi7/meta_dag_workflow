# meta_dag_workflow
We generate fully reproducible synthetic DAG workloads for heterogeneous scene and avatar tasks, where each DAG enforces acyclic connectivity, contains one mandatory scene node, and nodes carry multi-dimensional attributes sampled from predefined ranges, with topology and density controlled via deterministic seeding.
